        <li>salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, minced</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons crushed garlic</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds lean ground beef </li>
        <li>2 cups dry red wine</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>⅔ cup pimiento-stuffed green olives, drained and chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup capers, drained</li>
        <li>¼ cup golden raisins</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 pinch dried oregano</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Place the potatoes into a large pot with enough water to cover; season with salt. Bring the water to a boil; reduce heat to medium-low, place a cover on the pot, and cook the potatoes at a simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and set aside to cool.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat; cook and stir the onion, green bell pepper, and garlic in the hot oil until the vegetables soften, about 5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Crumble the ground beef into the onion mixture, breaking the meat into smaller pieces as you mix; cook and stir until the beef is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain as much fat from the mixture as possible.</p></li>
        <li><p>Stir the red wine, tomato sauce, olives, capers, golden raisins, cumin, oregano, black pepper, and 1/4 teaspoon salt into the ground beef mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until the wine had reduced significantly, 25 to 30 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Peel the cooled potatoes and cut into chunks.</p></li>
        <li><p>Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook the potatoes in the hot oil until browned, about 5 minutes.</p></li>
        <li><p>Gently fold the cooked potatoes into the simmering ground beef mixture; cook together 5 minutes.</p></li>
    </ol>
